This project relates to the article entitled "A frequency-amplitude coordinator and its optimal energy consumption for biological oscillators" which was submitted to Nature Communications.

The customized Maple code for computing the normal form of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model with the Neumann boundary condition is provided in this project. The codes for other cases are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

1. System requirements

a. The codes can be run in Maple environment on any operating system.

b. We implemented the codes in Maple18 on Windows 10.

c. No non-standard hardware is required.

2. Installation guide

a. The codes can be run directly without installation.

b. No install time is needed.

3. Demo

a. No data is needed to compute the normal form. The codes can be run without data.

b. By executing the entire worksheet, the normal form of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model (with the Neumann boundary condition) can be obtained. 
    The first Lyapunov coefficient \chi is also acquired which is equivalent to (S43) in Supplementary Information. 
    
c. Expected run time for this demo is approximately 2 seconds.

4. Instructions for use

a. Once the normal form and the first Lyapunov coefficient is obtained, we can input the specific parameters of the model for further analyses following the procedure given in the main text.
