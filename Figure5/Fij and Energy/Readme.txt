The codes and data in this repository are used to generate (raw) Figure 5c-f.

Run the script plotfig.mat, then the (raw) Figure 5c-d can be generated.

The data surf1.mat and surf2.mat corresponds to Figure 5e-f. These two figures needs to be edited manually in matlab using built-in inspector. 
Therefore, we only provide the (raw) Figures: surf1.fig and surf2.fig.
