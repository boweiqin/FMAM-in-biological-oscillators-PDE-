This repository are the source data for Figure 7d-i.

1. f11f12.mat stores the computed intensities for (independent) frequency, (independent) amplitude and hybrid coordinations.

2. AijFij_fc.mat stores the information: a_{ij} times f_{ij} for independent frequency coordination.

3. AijFij_ac.mat stores the information: a_{ij} times f_{ij} for independent amplitude coordination.

4. hybrid_Energy stores the energy consumed by hybrid coordination.
