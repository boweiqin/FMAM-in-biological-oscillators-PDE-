The customized Maple codes for computing the normal form of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model with three conventional boundary conditions.

1. System requirements
a. The codes can be run in Maple environment on any operating system.
b. We implemented the codes in Maple18 on Windows 10.
c. No non-standard hardware is required.

2. Installation guide
a. The codes can be run directly without installation.
b. No install time is needed.

3. Demo
a. No data is needed to compute the normal form. The codes can be run without data.
b. By executing the entire worksheet, the normal form of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model can be obtained. 
c. Expected run time for this demo is approximately less than one minute.

4. Instructions for use
a. Once the normal form is obtained, we can input the specific parameters of the model for further analyses following the procedure given in the main text.
